# Auto Formatting Application
New Auto Formatting Tool for project managers in enterprise business roles. This application is designed to take tedious spreadsheets such as project timelines or performance reports/updates and format them in very a consistent structure based off a single input.
For example, someone might input "Set a project reminder that John needs to send in his budget request by the end of the month." This program will identify the entities within this request, seperate them, categorize them, and compile them directly into a working google spreadsheet.
This way, project managers can avoid the tediousness of organizing their own data, and every spreadsheet/document is consistently formatted for ease of use.
